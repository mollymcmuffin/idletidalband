                Idle Tidal is a Singaporean dream pop band formed in Jurong West, 
                in 2018, by Bryan and Kum Seng. The band is known for their ethereal, 
                limerent and often dream-like musical style, lyrics often based on the 
                themes of romance and love, as well as Bryan's voice, which has been 
                described as "androgynous". While marketed as an ambient pop band, Idle Tidal are also considered to be shoegaze, slowcore and indie rock.
                The band's debut extended play (EP), Midnight, was released in 2020, with the song "The Night" eventually becoming a sleeper hit through commercial licensing. 
                After the release of "How I Miss" in 2021, the band released their self-titled debut studio album in 2022 to positive reviews. 
                The band's second studio album, Modern Depression, was released on March 25, 2022.
