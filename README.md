# Idle Tidal
https://mollymcmuffin.github.io/idletidalband/

- A simple website I made for my friends' band. 
- My first project relating to Web Development. Here, I touched on some basic HTML and CSS. I managed to use flexbox for some of the styling.
The JS features have not been implemented yet as I want to brush up more on my JS before coming back.
